1. Difference between document and window objects.

	DOCUMENT OBJECT:

	The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML elements that are placed in the form of a hierarchy tree.

	 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

	It is an essential part of the DOM and provides access to the content and structure of the web page.

	Developers use the document object to manipulate and interact with HTML elements, such as accessing and modifying content, changing styles, and handling events.

	Example properties and methods associated with the document object include getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), and more.

	You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.

	Document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. Screen object doesn't have any methods as in window and document objects.
	


	WINDOW OBJECT:

	The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 

	Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.It is based on a binary interface standard used in Windows for inter-process communication and component interaction.

	It provides access to browser-specific features and functionalities, such as controlling the browser's behavior, navigating to different URLs, managing history, and handling events related to the entire browser window.

	The window object also serves as the global scope for JavaScript code running in the browser, so variables and functions declared without a specific scope are attached to the window object.

	Example properties and methods associated with the window object include open(), close(), alert(), localStorage, and more.

	The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

	Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen. It refers to screen object associated with that window object. Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc
